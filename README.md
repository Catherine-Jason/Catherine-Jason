Hi, I’m Catherine Jason — a cybersecurity student, peer educator, and resource builder. I’m completing my AAS in Cybersecurity with a 4.0 GPA and Phi Theta Kappa honors. As a single mom of three, I bring resilience, curiosity, and clarity into every lab, project, and guide I create to empower others.
